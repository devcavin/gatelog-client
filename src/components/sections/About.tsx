            Gatelog started from a simple observation: almost every office, clinic,
            school, and gated community manages visitors with a paper logbook and
            almost all of them have the same problems with it. Limited way to search, low
            real-time visibility, manual audit trail that holds up.

            and they are built for multinational campuses, not small to medium institutions. Gatelog is built for those places. Fast enough for
            a busy front desk. Honest about what it does and what it does not do yet.
